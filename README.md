# youtube_alarm
It's an exciting project for a beginner developer like myself.
It has two parts random YouTube video player function and alarm part.
The alarm code is not ideal, but it's working. I'll keep working on it.

Libraries used for this project:
json
requests
string
random
webbrowser
datetime
time

You would need to have your API_KEY for the YouTube video player function.

You can find documentation on how to create key here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
